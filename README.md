## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer-based model and fine-tuned GPT-2 for an automated customer service chatbot using the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus. The Transformer notebook includes data preprocessing with NLTK, model architecture design, and training using TensorFlow, while the GPT-2 notebook emphasizes data preparation, fine-tuning, and saving the enhanced model using Transformers for improved conversational performance.


## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Load and preprocess data**: Load the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and clean the text.
- **Clean and tokenize text**: Apply text preprocessing techniques and tokenize the text.
- **Prepare input and target sequences for model training**: Format the data for training the model.

## Model Development
- **Define Transformer model architecture**: Include Encoder and Decoder components.
- **Implement attention mechanisms and other components**: Ensure the model utilizes effective attention mechanisms.

## Training, Validation, and Testing
- **Train the model**: Train the Transformer model on the preprocessed data.
- **Validate and test the model**: Evaluate the model's performance using validation and test sets.

## Chatbot Integration
- **Integrate the trained model into a chatbot application**: Build a functional chatbot using the trained model.

## Evaluation and Testing
- **Evaluate the chatbot's performance**: Assess how well the chatbot performs on test data.
- **Refine and improve the model**: Use feedback to enhance the model's accuracy and functionality.

## Iteration and Improvement
- **Ongoing improvements**: Continuously update and improve the chatbot's performance and features.

## Fine-Tuning GPT-2

This section describes how to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus.

### Fine-Tuning Notebook

The fine-tuning notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Setup and Installation**: Install necessary libraries (`transformers`, `datasets`).
2. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the dataset and apply preprocessing steps such as cleaning and tokenization.
3. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Convert the dataset into the format required for training GPT-2.
4. **Fine-Tune**: Train GPT-2 on the preprocessed data.
5. **Save the Fine-Tuned Model**: Save the model and tokenizer after fine-tuning.
