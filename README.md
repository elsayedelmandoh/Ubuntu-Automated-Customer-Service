# Ubuntu Automated Customer Service

## Project Overview

This project is focused on creating a conversational AI system designed to automate customer service for Ubuntu users. By leveraging the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, the system will be trained to understand customer queries and offer automated solutions. The project encompasses several key phases, including data preprocessing, development and training of a natural language processing (NLP) model, and the integration of this model into a chatbot interface that users can interact with.
